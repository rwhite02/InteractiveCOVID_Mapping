# InteractiveCOVID_Mapping

This lab utilizes javascript elements to create two interactive web maps, one that displays population density for each state in the United States and the other that displays COVID cases per 10,000 people in each county in Washington State up until October 25, 2021. The COVID case data is from The New York Times and the 2021 population estimates data used for calculating the rates is from Washington State Office of Financial Management.
